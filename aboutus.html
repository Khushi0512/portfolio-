                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A motivated and enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering student, I possess a keen passion, knowledge, and 
                    talent for web development. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in hands-on projects involving IoT 
                    technologies, particularly with Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. Furthermore, I have honed my skills in video and graphic editing, 
                    adeptly navigating software like Canva and Adobe Photoshop. Beyond the realm of technology, I am an avid enthusiast of creative writing, 
                    finding solace and inspiration in philosophical literature, books, and poems. Reading and writing serve as the essence of my creative expression,
                     akin to the nail polish that adds flair to my hands. Concurrently, I am pursuing a diploma in Practical Psychology from Indira Gandhi Open University while 
                     pursuing my undergraduate
                     studies in Engineering from Dharmsinh Desai University.<br> <br> In essence, I am a multifaceted individual with a diverse range of interests and 
                     talents. My dedication to mastering web development, coupled with my exploration of IoT projects and proficiency in graphic design, reflects my 
                     commitment to continuous learning and growth. Moreover, my passion for creative writing and philosophical inquiry not only enriches my personal 
                     life but also enhances my problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills. Through my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I strive to 
                     contribute meaningfully to the fields of technology and psychology, 
                     embodying a holistic approach to personal and professional development.</p>

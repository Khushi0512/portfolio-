This repository depects the making of a basic portfolio website. 
This portfolio site consists of a home page, an "about me" page and a "contact me" page which is directly linked to my email ID using my special public key, gmail service ID, and template ID. 
The website features a primary image transition, allowing photos to change upon clicking. 
It also has a "Download CV" button, from where the viewer can directly download your resume.
proj1.html is the entry point for the project.
